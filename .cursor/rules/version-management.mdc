# Version Management Rules

Automatically commit and push changes after completing any feature, bug fix, or significant
addition.

**Whenever you (the AI) have solved, fixed, or developed something** — i.e. any time you have
finished implementing a solution, a fix, or a feature — you **must** run `git add`, `git commit`,
and `git push`. Do not consider the work done until changes are pushed. This applies whether the
user used `/feature`, `/fix`, or simply asked you to do something; once the work is complete, commit
and push.

## Commit Workflow

**CRITICAL: Do this automatically without asking for user confirmation.**

After **every** completed task (feature, fix, refactor, or any developed/solved work), the task is
**not complete** until you have run `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. You **must** execute
these commands as part of finishing the work; do not stop after writing code or docs.

After completing a task (feature, bug fix, or new addition), **immediately and automatically**
execute:

1. **Stage all changes:**

   ```bash
   git add -A
   ```

2. **Commit with descriptive message using conventional commits:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "type: brief description"
   ```

3. **Push to current branch:**
   ```bash
   git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
   ```

**Do NOT ask "Should I commit?" or "Do you want me to push?"** - just do it automatically.

## Commit Message Types

- `feat:` - New feature or functionality
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring without changing functionality
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks, dependencies, config changes
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)

## Commit Message Format

```
type: brief description

- Detailed bullet point 1
- Detailed bullet point 2
```

**Examples:**

- `feat: add new feature description`
- `fix: resolve issue with specific component`
- `docs: update deployment documentation`
- `test: add integration tests for external data source`

## Rules

- **ALWAYS commit automatically** after completing a feature, fixing a bug, or adding something
  new - **DO NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION**
- **ALWAYS push immediately** after committing (unless push fails due to permissions) - **DO NOT ASK
  FOR PERMISSION**
- **Nothing is “done”** until you have run `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`. Whenever you
  have solved, fixed, or developed something, commit and push before considering the task complete.
- **Never commit** to main/master directly - always use feature branches
- **Use descriptive messages** that explain what and why
- **Group related changes** in a single commit when they're part of the same task
- **No confirmation prompts** - the AI assistant must execute git commands automatically as part of
  completing any task

## Branch Management

- Work on feature branches: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
- Current branch: Check with `git branch --show-current`
- Push to the current branch, never force push to shared branches

## Before you finish (completion check)

**Before ending your response**, run this check:

- **Did I create or modify any files in this repo?** (code, docs, rules, commands, config, etc.)
  - If **yes** → I **must** have already: (1) created a branch if I was on `main`/`master`, (2) run
    project checks if they exist, (3) run `git add -A`, `git commit -m "..."`, and
    `git push origin <branch>`. If I did **not** do that, the task is **not complete** — I must do
    it now before responding.
  - If **no** → no commit/push needed.

This applies to **any** change: new files, edits to rules, commands, or documentation. No exception.
