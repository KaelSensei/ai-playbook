# Documentation Maintenance Rules

**CRITICAL: Update documentation automatically after every code change.**

After completing any feature, bug fix, refactor, or significant change, **immediately and
automatically** update the relevant documentation files.

## Required Documentation Updates

### 1. Project Progress Documentation (If Present)

After **any** create/change/update/delete operation, update project progress documentation (e.g.,
`PROGRESS.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or similar):

- **For new features**: Add to the completed features section with `[x]` checkbox
- **For bug fixes**: Note the fix in the relevant section
- **For refactors**: Update the description if functionality changed
- **Update "Last updated"** timestamp if the file includes one

**Examples:**

- `[x] **Feature Name**: Brief description of what was added`
- `[x] **Bug Fix**: Description of the issue that was resolved`

### 2. Architecture Documentation

If you modify:

- **Database schema** → Update architecture documentation (schema section)
- **External data sources** → Update architecture doc (data import section)
- **Data flow** → Update architecture doc (data flow section)
- **UI components** → Update architecture doc (UI section) if structure changed significantly

### 3. Development Plan Documentation

If the project maintains a step-by-step development plan:

- Mark completed steps as done
- Update any notes or implementation details

### 4. README.md

Update `README.md` if:

- New features change how the application works
- Build/install instructions change
- New dependencies are added
- Usage instructions need updating

### 5. Deployment Documentation

If deployment documentation exists (e.g., `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `RELEASE.md`):

- Update when build process changes
- Update when signing/configuration changes
- Update when new deployment steps are needed

## Documentation Update Workflow

**CRITICAL: Do this automatically without asking for user confirmation.**

1. **After completing code changes**, immediately:
   - Read project progress documentation (if present) to understand current state
   - Update progress documentation with the new feature/fix/change
   - Check if architecture docs need updates
   - Update other relevant docs if needed

2. **Include documentation updates in the same commit** as the code changes:
   - Stage both code and documentation files together
   - Commit with a message that includes both code and docs updates
   - Example: `feat: add search reset button and update docs`

3. **Do NOT ask "Should I update the docs?"** - just do it automatically.

## Documentation Standards

- **Be specific**: Describe what was added/changed, not just "updated feature"
- **Use checkboxes**: `[x]` for completed items in progress documentation
- **Keep it concise**: One line per feature/fix in progress documentation
- **Update timestamps**: Always update "Last updated" timestamps if present
- **Link related changes**: If multiple files changed, mention all in documentation

## Examples

**Good documentation update:**

```markdown
- [x] **Feature Name**: Clear description of what was added and why
- [x] **Bug Fix**: Description of the issue that was resolved
```

**Bad documentation update:**

```markdown
- [x] Updated feature
```

## Rules

- **ALWAYS update project documentation** after any code change - **DO NOT ASK FOR PERMISSION**
- **ALWAYS include docs in the same commit** as code changes
- **ALWAYS update "Last updated"** timestamps if present in documentation
- **Check architecture docs** if database, data sources, or major UI structure changes
- **No confirmation prompts** - documentation updates are mandatory, not optional

These rules ensure documentation stays in sync with code and provides accurate project status.
